The line was not ready in time, and the first car was actually operated between Jones and Kearny in the early morning darkness of August 2nd. To make sure his franchise rights were protected, Hallidie always claimed that the testing had occurred on the morning of the 1st. Although there were newspaper accounts of the August 2nd testing, Hallidie's version prevailed, and the truth of the matter was not generally known until many years later.\nThe line was immediately popular and profitable, and allowed development of an area that had been largely undeveloped, since it had been accessible only to those who could afford private transportation up a hill too steep for horsecar service.

Separate fares were charged on the cable and steam lines, making the service to the beach quite profitable for the SP's owners. (The steam line was converted to electric service in June 1898.)\nAfter the opening of the line, squatters made claims on land at the beach and erected a series of shacks called Mooneysville, from which they sold coffee, liquor, or anything else that they could sell to the thousands who arrived by the railroad. The squatters saw no reason why, since Crocker, Stanford, and company had broken the law by having the railroad built, they could not make some money of their own from the railroad's passengers.

Cable car lines changed the pattern of S.F.'s population growth — instead of south of Market and east of the hills, new population growth was to the north and west.\nS.F. had eight cable companies operating twenty-two lines (not including the funicular line on Telegraph Hill, and counting the Clay St. Hill line and Sacramento-Clay line as separate lines).

But it was later learned that the URR had bribed Mayor Schmitz and 17 of the 18 supervisors through the good offices of political boss Abe Ruef, who pocketed $65,000 of the $200,000 in bribe money.

These conversions were part of the general pattern of the conversion of most of the nation's streetcar service to rubber-tired operations, a continuation of the trend that had begun before the war.\nMany of S.F.'s conversions were to trolley buses instead of motor buses, in part because of the \"free\" electricity from the city's Hetch Hetchy hydroelectric system in the Sierra Nevada. The conversions did not challenge the inherited pattern of service (some of it from horsecar and cable car days), although travel patterns had changed dramatically, both in the city and throughout the region.\nThese conversions occurred virtually without public hearings, since the city attorney's office had ruled that the substitution of one mode of service for another on the same route did not constitute abandonment of service — a ruling that remained in effect until it was overturned by an S.F.
