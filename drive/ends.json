Ground was broken in 2010 and Muni estimates that the Central Subway will carry roughly 35,100 riders per day by 2030.","overview":"Muni Metro is the modern incarnation of the traditional streetcar system that had served San Francisco since the late 19th century. It is the US' third-busiest light rail system after Boston and Los Angeles. Muni Metro operates a fleet of 151 light rail vehicles (LRV) made by Breda.

This is an important step taken to meet the goals of the “Zero Emissions 2020” plan. While hybrid buses are more expensive, lower fuel and maintenance costs are expected to offset the higher initial cost.","overview":"Nowadays, Muni operates approximately 80 routes throughout San Francisco with stops within 2 blocks of 90% of all residences in the city.  Some of Muni’s routes operate 24 hour a day."},"Cable Car":{"v":"Cable Car","stat2":"Average fleet age in years (2011):101.7","stat1":"Fare revenue (2011):$24,933,061","links":"http://www.sfcablecar.com/","next":"The city continues to preserve the cable car system its iconic status. Nevertheless, vehicle safety has become a major concern for the cable car transportation systems. Records obtained by the Associated Press in 2013 showed that over the course of three years, the city of San Francisco had paid almost $8 million to settle around four dozen legal claims relating to cable car accidents. During the past 10 years, there has been 126 accidents and 151 injured persons reported by the city of San Francisco.","overview":"San Francisco’s cable car system plays a vital role in the history of San Francisco’s transit--the first cable car line began service in 1873, which led to other cable car systems to follow suit.\n\nToday, it stands as the world’s last manually operated cable car system. It is also one of two National Historic Landmarks that move (New Orleans’ St. Charles streetcar line being the other). Its role has shifted from the city’s primary transit mode to a popular tourist attraction.

BART will continue to improve on safety.","overview":"Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) is a rapid transit system serving the San Francisco Bay Area. The heavy-rail public transit subway system connects San Francisco with cities in the East Bay and suburbs in northern San Mateo County.

Additionally, MUNI is looking at plans to convert some diesel lines to electric trolley buses. They will acquire 240 40-foot standard trolleys. All 284 standard Flyer buses (acquired 1976-1977) are being retired. Also being added are 33 additional articulated 60-foot trolley buses.","overview":"Trolley buses are uniquely suited to San Francisco. Not only are they cleaner and more energy efficient, they also operate better on hilly terrains, which is common in the city. Today, San Francisco has the largest trolley bus fleet of any transit agency in the U.S. and Canada. San Francisco's trolley buses (as well as its streetcars and the cable motors for the cable cars) are almost entirely pollution-free, since their electric power comes from the city's hydroelectric Hetch Hetchy Water & Power Project."}}
