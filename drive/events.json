Muni-bashing had always been something of a civic sport for San Franciscans, and not without reason: the Boeing trains were sub-par and grew crowded quickly, and the difficulty in running a system that was half-streetcar and half-subway, with five different routes merging into one, led to scheduling chaos on the main trunk lines, with long waits between arrivals, and commuter-packed trains sometimes sitting motionless in tunnels for extended periods of time.[citation needed]\n\nMuni did take steps to meet these problems. Newer, larger Breda cars were ordered, an extension of the system towards South Beach — where many of the new dot-coms were headquartered — was built, and the underground section was switched to automatic train control (ATC). The Breda cars, however, came in noisy, overweight, oversized, under-braked, and over-budget (their price grew from US$2.2 million per car to nearly US$3 million over the course of their production).[34][35] In fact, the new trains were so heavy (10,000 pounds (4,500 kg) more than the Boeing LRVs they replaced) that some homeowners, claiming that the exceptional weight of the Breda cars damaged their foundations, sued the city of San Francisco.[36] The Breda cars are longer and wider than the previous Boeing cars, necessitating the modification of subway stations and maintenance yards, as well as the rear view mirrors on the trains themselves.[35] Furthermore, the Breda cars are not run in three car trains, like the Boeing cars used to, as doing so had, in some instances, physically damaged the overhead power wires.[37] The Breda trains were so noisy that San Francisco budgeted over $15 million to quiet them down, while estimates range up to $1 million per car to remedy the excessive noise.[38] To this day, the Breda cars are noisier than the PCC or Boeing cars. In 1998, NTSB inspectors mandated a lower speed limit of 30 mph (48 km/h), down from 50 mph (80 km/h), because the brakes were problematic.[39][40]\n\nThe ATC system was plagued by numerous glitches when first implemented, initially causing significantly more harm than good. Common occurrences included sending trains down the wrong tracks, and, more often, inappropriately applying emergency braking.[41] Eventually the result was a spectacular service crisis, widely referred to as the \"Muni meltdown\", in the summer of 1998. During this period, two reporters for the San Francisco Chronicle—one riding in the Muni Metro tunnel and one on foot on the surface—held a race through downtown, with the walking reporter emerging the winner.[42]\n[edit]","Type of Vehicle":"Cable Car, Street Car, Light Rail, Motor Bus, Trolley Bus","Day":"","Month":""},{"Description":"LRVs on the T Line, servicing the San Francisco Giant's baseball game against the Atlanta Braves","Image":"light-rail/2007.jpg","Year":"2007","Tag":"opening","Source":"http://sfmta.photoshelter.com/gallery-image/Light-Rail-Vehicles/G0000aBtCTky.nDs/I00000q5G7WWCB04/C00004fEHmpU3KGU","Event Description":"A new, extensive line known as the T Third Street opened, as part of the Third Street Light Rail Project, running south from the current Caltrain depot station along Third Street.

A key element of the study was an \"on board\" survey, begun in March 1975, of over 130,000 Muni weekday riders. Route deficiencies were outlined, and it was pointed out that although over 70% of Muni's service operated to or through downtown, 2/3rds of all trips made by city residents were to and from areas other than the central business district. Further, there was poor spacing of routes, with duplicative service in some areas and gaps in others, leaving some parts of the city relatively isolated.\nThe POM Study made several recommendations to improve the efficiency and usefulness of Muni operations. A major recommendation was that Muni implement a modified \"grid\" route system to improve crosstown service, so that most riders would be able to get from any part of the city to any other with no more than one transfer.\nOther proposals were that Muni should redistribute its duplicative service to where it was most needed, and provide \"feeder\" service to BART and Muni Metro (as Muni's planned surface-and-subway streetcar system had come to be called). Also, it was proposed that shorter routes be converted into longer ones, providing better through-service, offering improved transfer opportunities, and reducing the number of time-consuming terminal loops.\nBecause of the city's financial constraints, all of the recommendations in the study had to be accomplished without any increase in hours of operation.
