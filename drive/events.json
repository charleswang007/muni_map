The line was shut down for conversion to the bottom-grip operation that was used on the other cable lines, so that it could operate from the Washington-Mason barn.)\n\nAccording to the 1959 court decision, abandonment of service on the B line, like the Washington-Jackson line, did not have the required public notification and hearings. Buses were substituted for streetcars on Geary in part because it was thought that streetcars and their tracks would interfere with plans for a widening of Geary to encourage auto traffic. \n\n(Plans for BART were under way, and it was also thought that there would be a rapid transit line on Geary. In the early 1970s, a proposal for BART service for the Geary corridor was rejected by Richmond District residents, who feared that the stations would encourage high-density development that was out of character for their neighborhood.)\n\nThere were later attempts to convert the five remaining streetcar lines into other kinds of operations, but as in other cities where streetcar service was saved, these lines were retained because the public was opposed to their removal — the streetcars, often on their own right-of-ways, provided relatively fast, smooth, and reliable service.","Source":"http://www.sfcityguides.org/public_guidelines.html?article=1232&submitted=TRUE&srch_text=&submitted2=&topic=Transportation","Month":"Apr"},{"Type of Vehicle":"Street Car","Day":"15","Description":"San Francisco MUNI A-Type 1","Tag":"anniversary","Year":"1969","Image":"street-car/1969.jpg","Event Description":"The beginning of a week of events celebrating Muni's 50th anniversary, including a streetcar shuttle service on Market St. provided by newly restored car No. 1 for a 5¢ fare.","Source":"http://www.nycsubway.org/wiki/MUNI_F-Market_Line","Month":"Apr"},{"Type of Vehicle":"Street Car","Day":"21","Description":"PCC 1034 at Church and 30th Sts. in July 1972.

Muni-bashing had always been something of a civic sport for San Franciscans, and not without reason: the Boeing trains were sub-par and grew crowded quickly, and the difficulty in running a system that was half-streetcar and half-subway, with five different routes merging into one, led to scheduling chaos on the main trunk lines, with long waits between arrivals, and commuter-packed trains sometimes sitting motionless in tunnels for extended periods of time.[citation needed]\n\nMuni did take steps to meet these problems. Newer, larger Breda cars were ordered, an extension of the system towards South Beach — where many of the new dot-coms were headquartered — was built, and the underground section was switched to automatic train control (ATC). The Breda cars, however, came in noisy, overweight, oversized, under-braked, and over-budget (their price grew from US$2.2 million per car to nearly US$3 million over the course of their production).[34][35] In fact, the new trains were so heavy (10,000 pounds (4,500 kg) more than the Boeing LRVs they replaced) that some homeowners, claiming that the exceptional weight of the Breda cars damaged their foundations, sued the city of San Francisco.[36] The Breda cars are longer and wider than the previous Boeing cars, necessitating the modification of subway stations and maintenance yards, as well as the rear view mirrors on the trains themselves.[35] Furthermore, the Breda cars are not run in three car trains, like the Boeing cars used to, as doing so had, in some instances, physically damaged the overhead power wires.[37] The Breda trains were so noisy that San Francisco budgeted over $15 million to quiet them down, while estimates range up to $1 million per car to remedy the excessive noise.[38] To this day, the Breda cars are noisier than the PCC or Boeing cars. In 1998, NTSB inspectors mandated a lower speed limit of 30 mph (48 km/h), down from 50 mph (80 km/h), because the brakes were problematic.[39][40]\n\nThe ATC system was plagued by numerous glitches when first implemented, initially causing significantly more harm than good. Common occurrences included sending trains down the wrong tracks, and, more often, inappropriately applying emergency braking.[41] Eventually the result was a spectacular service crisis, widely referred to as the \"Muni meltdown\", in the summer of 1998. During this period, two reporters for the San Francisco Chronicle—one riding in the Muni Metro tunnel and one on foot on the surface—held a race through downtown, with the walking reporter emerging the winner.[42]\n[edit]","Source":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidwilson1949/6546396117/","Month":""},{"Type of Vehicle":"Light Rail","Day":"","Description":"LRVs on the T Line, servicing the San Francisco Giant's baseball game against the Atlanta Braves","Tag":"opening","Year":"2007","Image":"light-rail/2007.jpg","Event Description":"A new, extensive line known as the T Third Street opened, as part of the Third Street Light Rail Project, running south from the current Caltrain depot station along Third Street.
